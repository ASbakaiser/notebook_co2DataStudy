# CO2 Study Case
A study case of cumulative CO2 emissions for each country by year from 1700.

# DataSet choice
I chose the CO2 dataset because the subject was interesting, and I think I can obtain many metrics. It's going to be a good training

# Technical stack and choice
## I choose Python because
 it is the most popular language according to the TIOBE index.
 Python libraries and frameworks are often used in data analysis, engineering, and ML.
## I choose Jupyter
 because, for me, it is really efficient in rendering code and graphics.
 With the Voila framework, it's easy to quickly show something for business.
