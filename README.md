# DataSet choice
I chose the CO2 dataset because the subject was interesting, and I think I can obtain many metrics. It's going to be a good training

# Technical stack and choice
## I choose Python because
 it is the most popular language according to the TIOBE index.
 Python libraries and frameworks are often used in data analysis, engineering, and ML.
## I choose Jupyter
 because, for me, it is really efficient in rendering code and graphics.
 With the Voila framework, it's easy to quickly show something for business.

You can find a render of my work there, the graph are made plotly, 
it's work with Js so you will not have a good render with jupyter file  : https://rurutea.github.io/co2DataStudy/
